Our services are based on accessing, collecting and processing data from the following established sources:

- Foursquare location data for the location and characterization of locations and businesses based on multiple attributes, mostly quantitative, and also provided by the platform users themselves. These data are the basis for issuing recommendations based on the concentration of businesses in a particular location, but user evaluation should also be considered. Since a business concentration that has been evaluated moderately negative can be a business opportunity for our clients. 

- Data from government sources. Organisms that collect and process data related to commercial and tax activity are used to know how the mass of workers is distributed in particular sectors, as well as the economic category potentially to be served as clients of our clients. Data to be used are, but not all:
  - Business area
  - Tax ID
  - Number of workers
  - Headquarters location

- Population census sources will be used to identify potentially serviceable population clusters. Depending on the client's needs and the nature of their business, permanent or floating populations should be analyzed to find the best location recommendation.

- Sources of data that can be used to define a certain region in terms of its boundaries, for example files with JSON-type geo-referenced information.
